# Rust Testing

## Model Fixtures

- Use `create_demo_model()` for tests that do not require reproducibility.
- Use `create_demo_model_seeded(seed)` when tests need deterministic behavior (e.g. reference comparison, regression).

```rust
// ✅ GOOD
let model = create_demo_model();
let engine = InferenceEngine::new(model);

// ✅ GOOD (deterministic)
let model = create_demo_model_seeded(42);
let logits_a = engine.forward(&[0, 1, 2]).unwrap();
```

## Test Names and Assertions

- Test names and assertion messages in English (see project English-only rule for comments/docs).
